<h3>Getting  and Cleaning Data in R </h3><br>
---------------------------------<br>
The following are the steps executed in this project<br>
1. Download the file from the link https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip <br>
2. Unzip the contents<br>
3. There are three kinds of data 1.Features data 2. Subject data 3. Activity data <br>
4. Each of them are again under traning data and test data<br>
5. We combine the training and test data under each category<br>
6. Finally we generate a data frame which has all the variables and dependencies among these variables<br>
7. We extract the observations related to mean and standard deviation in the features <br>
8. Finally we factorize the data based on activity labels<br>
9. Copy this data set into a text file as tidy data which can be used for further analysis<br>
